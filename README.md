Used Ktor Features

    -Sessions: Used to handle session management. Cookie-based sessions are implemented in this server.
    -Interception: This server intercepts every call to check if the session exists or not. If not, a new session is created with the given client_id.
    -WebSockets: The server uses the WebSocket protocol for real-time bidirectional communication between the server and clients.
    -Routing: Defines endpoints for creating and joining rooms and also for handling WebSocket connections for the game.
    -Content Negotiation: The server uses Gson to convert Kotlin objects to JSON and vice versa.
    -Call Logging: Logs all HTTP requests and responses, providing useful debugging information.
